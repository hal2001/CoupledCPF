# CoupledCPF
... Coupled Conditional Particle Filters

These scripts reproduce the figures for the paper "Coupling of Particle Filters" by Pierre E. Jacob, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Sch√∂n.

Functions are provided for the Rhee--Glynn estimators of smoothing functionals,
including versions with Rao--Blackwellization and other variance reduction techniques, 
with and without ancestor sampling.
For comparison, particle filters and fixed-lag smoothers are also implemented.
